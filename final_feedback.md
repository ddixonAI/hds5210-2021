Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nice narrative throughout.  I liked hearing your thought process as you worked through the notebook.  It guided my understanding of what you were trying to do.

Always like to see good use of violin plots.  It was a find exploration of the data, but I'm not sure what to conclude.  The fact that it is so imbalanced / weighted toward 0, makes me wonder who the outliers are / is.  I didn't see you explore that further.

The correlation plots seem to tell us a lot.  Look at Hapiness v Healthcare Expenditure per capita!!  Happier places spend exponentially more on healthcare (at least in general) it would seem!

And, of course, while money can't buy happiness, it sure can stave off hopelessness.

You did a lot of breakdown by year, but I would have really appreciated seeing which countries lie where in this data.  What other geographic and social characteristics might help us understand better.  European, North American, Asian, African countries.  How does culture impact the strength of these correlations between happiness and healthcare spending, for example.

Great, provocative data choices and nice observations along the way.  Nice work!
